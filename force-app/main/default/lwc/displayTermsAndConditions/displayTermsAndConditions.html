              <b>9. Mandatory FMCSA Compliance.</b> <u>The FMCSA prohibits operators of commercial motor vehicles from using hand-held cell phones while operating their vehicles.</u> You expressly agree that you and your motor carrier operators, subcontracted parties, owner-operators, and your company drivers shall not use a hand-held cell phone while driving, nor shall any such operator of a commercial motor vehicle view or send text messages while driving. You agree to access the Developer Portal and/or Content and Services only when stopped in a safe and lawful manner, and to access the Developer Portal and/or Content and Services in full compliance with all federal and state rules and regulations.

              <b>10.The Code of Federal Regulations.</b> 49 CFR §§ 392.80 and 392.82 state the FMCSA’s restrictions on the use of hand-held mobile phones. The following actions are prohibited while driving a Commercial Motor Vehicle (“CMV”):<br/>
                    
                    . Using at least one hand to hold a mobile telephone to conduct a voice communication;<br/>

                    . Dialing or answering a hand-held mobile telephone by pressing more than a single button; or<br/>

                    . Reaching for a mobile telephone in a manner that requires a driver to maneuver so that he or she  is no longer in a seated driving position, restrained by a seat belt that is installed in accordance with federal regulations that has been adjusted in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.<br/>

                    For purposes of the rule, “driving” means operating a CMV on a highway, including while temporarily stopped in traffic because of a traffic control device or other momentary delay. “Driving” does not include operating a commercial motor vehicle when the driver has moved the vehicle to the side of, or off, a highway and has halted in a location where the vehicle can safely remain stationary (please note, however, that pulling to the side of a highway may not, in some instances, be allowed under applicable law). The rule is in addition to the existing federal ban on texting while driving a CMV. Importantly, federal law prohibits standing, parking or stopping on the side of an interstate highway unless for an emergency or by directed by police enforcement officials. Other roads within the United States road system may also have similar restrictions.<br/>

              <b>11.	Road information prevails.</b> Any traffic or road-related information provided by the Content and Services is not intended to replace the information provided on the road, such as traffic signs, traffic lights, police instructions, etc. You expressly agree and acknowledge that you will use your senses to observe all road information and abide by such lawful information regardless of the contents of the Developer Portal and/or Content and Services.<br/>

              <b>12.	Cautious driving.</b> Always drive vigilantly according to road conditions and in accordance with traffic laws. It is strictly forbidden to send traffic updates (such as updates on road accidents and traffic congestion), while driving. Such updates may only be sent after you have safely stopped your vehicle in an appropriate location permitted by law. You expressly agree and acknowledge that you shall not communicate with Landstar by phone unless a lawful, hands-free device is used, or you are safely stopped.<br/>

              <b>13.	The Internet connection is your responsibility and at your expense.</b> Accessing the Developer Portal and/or Content and Services, requires an online (Wi-Fi or LTE/3G/4G/5G) connection between your device and the Internet. The expenses of such connection are as prescribed by the agreement between you and your communication service provider (such as your cellular company or internet provider), and according to its applicable terms of payment. You understand that your service provider may apply charges for text and data usage. You agree to pay for all such fees and charges.<br/>

              <b>14.	Location-based service.</b> Some features of the Content and Services make use of detailed location and route information, for example in the form of GPS signals and other information sent by your device on which any Content and Services are installed. These features cannot be provided without utilizing this technology. Landstar may use your location and route information to create a detailed location history (“History”) of all of your journeys made when using any Content and Services. You expressly agree and consent to Landstar’s creation of a History. You can choose whether or not to allow the Content and Services to collect and use real-time information about your device’s location through the device’s privacy settings, but location information is required for many of the functionality of the Content and Services. You may block the use of location information at any time, though if you block the use of location information, the Content and Services may be then inaccessible or not function properly.<br/>

              <b>15.	History and User ID.</b> Landstar uses this History to offer the Content and Services to you, to improve the quality of the Content and Services it offers to you and to all of its users and to improve the accuracy of its mapping and navigation data. This History is associated with your account and user identification (a unique identifier, email addresses or other combination of characters and numbers used to identify a user collectively referred to as “User ID”), if applicable (if you have chosen to set up a User ID). This History is retained by Landstar for a limited period of time and in accordance with the <a href="https://landstar-it.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/5f000003y9zC/a/5f000000odMg/zGjoG4k8hMDoSScTOxtkJ.vEPmXQ4zV9sX2ygJ2jvEY" target="_blank">Privacy Policy (Developer Portal)</a>). Landstar allows you to use the Content and Services whether or not you choose to set up a User ID for yourself. If you choose to use the Content and Services without setting up a User ID you may do so by skipping the User ID setup stage of the application installation process. Landstar will still link all of your information with your account and a unique identifier generated by Landstar in accordance with the <a href="https://landstar-it.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/5f000003y9zC/a/5f000000odMg/zGjoG4k8hMDoSScTOxtkJ.vEPmXQ4zV9sX2ygJ2jvEY" target="_blank">Privacy Policy (Developer Portal)</a>. Note that in order to access certain features, functionality, and the Content and Services you will need to set up a User ID.<br/>

              <b>16.	Free software.</b> The Developer Portal and/or Content and Services may utilize software for map displays, updates and road information. With respect to some cellular telephone devices running the software, the software is or may be free software.

Except as expressly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement or the Agreement makes either party the agent or legal representative of the other for any purpose whatsoever, nor grants either party any authority to assume or create any obligation on behalf or in the name of the other party. <br />

              <b>18.	Your age.</b> For the avoidance of doubt, the Developer Portal and/or Content and Services are intended for use by users who are of the legal age required to hold a commercial motor vehicle operator’s license. In any case, accounts of users under the age of eighteen (18) years will be cancelled and deleted by Landstar, upon receiving notice.<br />
